guile-toxcore
=============

Guile Scheme bindings for [libtoxcore](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore).

Usage
-----

There are 2 ways to use guile-toxcore.  The `(tox)` module exports a
high-level API that performs error checking and abstracts away the handling of
foreign data types and pointers.  This is almost certainly the API that you
want to use.  However, if you desire to build up your own abstractions on top
of the low-level C bindings or the high level bindings do not do what you
want, use the `(tox bindings)` module.

To use the high-level API:

```
(use-modules (tox))

(with-tox (make-tox)
  ;; TODO: Call your friend to ask if they've read their SICP today.
  (display "Hello, Tox!\n"))
```

To use the low-level API:

```
(use-modules (tox bindings))

(define tox (tox-new 1))

(tox-kill tox)
```
